### - Relax
Relax has various ions, calcium chelators, and ATP to minimize contraction and keep the muscle viable for future experimentation. Relax solutions is used when working to isolate muscle bundles and fibers and forms the basis of the skinning solution and storage solution. An example recipe can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/How-to_Permeabilized_Muscle_Preparations/tree/main/Solutions/Relax).
