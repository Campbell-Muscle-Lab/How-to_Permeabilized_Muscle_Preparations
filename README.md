### - Relax
Relax has various ions, calcium chelators, and ATP to minimize contraction and keep the muscle viable for future experimentation. Relax solutions is used when working to isolate muscle bundles and fibers and forms the basis of the skinning solution and storage solution. An example recipe can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/How-to_Permeabilized_Muscle_Preparations/tree/main/Solutions/Relax).
### - Chemical Permeabilization
Chemical permeabilization, also called chemical skinning, uses Triton X-100 to permeabilize the muscle fiber and allows for tight control of the chemical constituents around the myofilaments within the muscle fiber. Our skinning solution is 3 mL 1% Triton X-100 in 30 mL Relax. An example procedure for preparation and skinning of skeletal muscle fibers can be found [here](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/How-to_Permeabilized_Muscle_Preparations/blob/main/Solutions/Chemical%20Skinning/Skeletal_Muscle_Bundle_Preparation.docx).

After isolating muscle bundles from a sample, they can be gently tied to a capillary tube and stored in
